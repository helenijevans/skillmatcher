# SKILLMATCHER

A python script that returns UK-based jobs based on your skillset.
The script scrapes LinkedIn for jobs matching the combination of skills and keywords along with a given location. You also optionally have the choice to write the results to a csv file.

## Limitations

Currently the geographic regions covered by this program are:
United Kingdom (General Search), Bristol, Manchester, Newcastle, Leeds, London and Reading.

## How to Run

Clone the repository and run the "main.py" file. Enter your location and skills when prompted and the script will do its thing.
